# Pasta_Time_Series
Pasta sales time series analysis

This project is a part of the ADS-506 course in the Applied Data Science Program at the University of San Diego.

The dataset worked in this project comes from Mendeley Data (Mancuso, 2021) and it contains sales data gathered from an Italian grocery store. It has the daily sales form 01-01-2014 to 31-12-2018 for 118 different products, which are divided in four brands. The second part of the dataset contains a column for each of the 118 products stating if that product was or not on promotion that day. To identify the columns, they follow this name structure that shows if the column is for a quantity or promotion (“QTY” or “PROMO”), then it gives the brand of the product (B1, B2, B3, or B4), and finally it has the number that identifies the product. For example, “QTY_B1_2” is the column for the quantity sold by the product number two of the brand one. There are no missing values in the data set.
